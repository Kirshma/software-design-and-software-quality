# Overview: What is this project?

This repository contains a collection of classes regarding my study subjects in the field of software design and software quality.
<br>By writing some small exemplary classes I was able to improve my understanding of software design patterns, architectural design and testing.
<br>My study courses cover the following topics and subtopics:
1. External (e.g. correctness, robustness, efficiency)  vs internal (e.g. modularity, readability, testability) software criteria
2. Five criteria for modularity: Decomposability, Composability, Understandability, Continuity, Protection
3. Five rules for modularity: Direct Mapping, Few Interface, Small interfaces, Explicit Interfaces, Information Hiding
4. Metrics and heuristics of design: low coupling and high cohesion is desired
5. Test driven development
6. JUnit tests: TestSuites, parameterized tests, test inheritance and structure, test tags (@Before, @Test(expected=Exception.class,...)
7. Hamcrest for description-style assertions
8. Mockito mock testing of units that are not available at the time of testing
9. Dependency injection (Google Guice)
10. Graphical user interface testing (Selenium web UI testing) 
11. Code coverage in tests (Emma open-source tool for line coverage)
12. Black-/whitebox tests
13. Data driven tests
14. Fault seeding
15. Design patterns:
  <br> 1. Strategy
  <br> 2. State
  <br> 3. Command
  <br> 4. Composite
  <br> 5. Decorator
  <br> 6. Visitor
  <br> 7. Bridge
  <br> 8. Singleton
  <br> 9. Abstract Factory
  <br>10. Factory method
  <br>11. Prototype
  <br>12. Builder...
 11. Refactoring
 12. Debugging
 13. Performance Profiling
 14. Coding Conventions (naming, structure, program layout, comments, spacing, Google Java Style Guide, ...)
 15. Complexity metrics
 16. ISO 25010 software product quality traits and attributes
 17. Software-quality-management (Capability Maturity Model Integration CMMI, Quamoco)
 18. Code Smells (copy-paste code, long methods, long parameter lists, temporary fields, unhelpful or long comments,god classes, ...) 
 
 <br>And more
